                                <p>This year's Citizenship report would include the usual printed executive summary—the highlights of the year—and interactive PDF that contains all stories. However, to increase visibility and accessibility of these stories, the executive summary would also be made into a microsite. Sketch concepts surrounded how to apply brand elements consistently across all three formats, while considering their unique restrictions.</p>

                                <p>To create cross-polination between all three mediums, it was important to understand how they can work together. Through creating wireframes for the microsite and these three sample user flows, I was able to help the client narrow in on their main goals and in turn, focus our resources.</p>

The PDF features a global navigation, links to external videos and resources, and varied layouts to make the content more digestible. As lead on this project, it was my responsiblity to organize and lay out content, select and edit photos, art direct icon development, and manage milestones.</p>

Creating separate pages for each pillar, and separate views for each highlight story allowed for easy sharing across social media platforms. The site encourages a leisurely reading experience through light and airy layouts, limited content, and user-control via long scrolls. The printed executive summary and full interactive PDF are accessible for download on every page.</p>
