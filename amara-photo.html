                                <p>Amara Photo became my client with a request to expand the brand and create business cards based on a crowd-sourced logo. With the request of letterpressed business cards, I advised modifications to their logo. After various iterations, a refined logo and logotype in a monochromatic palette emerged.</p>

                                <p>The palette was expanded to include other bold colors, such as a mint green and a slate gray. Simple typography and a graphic border were developed for the thick cotton stock destined for the letterpress. <i>Photos courtesy of Amara Photo.</i></p>

It was a pleasure working with such beautiful photographs.</p>
