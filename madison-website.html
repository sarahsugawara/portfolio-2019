                                <p>Madison Design's website was outdated—not to mention unresponsive to devices. I embarked on researching competitors, website trends, and ways to capture Madison's vibrant and straightforward design aesthetic. The process included 3 layout concepts, detailed comps for the main pages, and strategies for how to display work and tell stories. </p>

                                <p>Implementation involved translating flat comps to the current Wordpress site using the Divi theme and some personal minor modifications. Once the site structure was complete, I moved on to the planning and management of every project story. The goal of each is to convey the process—versus just the final product—through the photography, digital assets, and copywriting.</p>

                                <p>Once the website was launched, I began Phase 2: social media. After specifying our goals, which included driving traffic to our website, I researched platform pros and cons to determine where to place our focus. After creating deployment benchmarks, personas, post types, and size templates for each channel, I created an interactive guide to help empower others to participate.</p>
