                                <p>As a member of the strategy team, I worked with the hired design firm to maintain brand equity and create a deployment process that would be doable with our resources. After the site's design was complete and passed to a partnering developer, I continued to project manage the implementation, meetings, and revisions.</p>

                                <p>Even though the site was built, launch required all of our relevant projects to be displayed in their full glory. This involved working with our designers, architects, engineers, and writers to compose each story with process diagrams, renderings, and photographs. Managing the development of approximately 30 project pages across many design teams required multi-tasking, plenty of offline and online conversations, and design ideation.</p>

                                <p>In addition to projects, employees often included in proposals, were to have bios. I orchestrated multiple photoshoots to capture a headshot for each employee—personally shooting and editing all photos.

                                <p>Overall, projects, people, and the studio required new imagery to depict the design thinking, inter-disciplinary collaboration, and attention to detail that SMMA put into every project. I involved myself in meetings, activities, and projects to gain insight into these people and processes so I could better capture them in photos or graphics.</p>
