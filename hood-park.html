                                <p>Our relationship with Hood Park began with the rebranding of their business park—located at an old milk facility. In addition to exploring a new visual identity, we explored names that would allow for a broader selection of tenants.</p>

                                <p>The task of master planning their business park began as a competition. I wrapped our team's design proposal in a hand-made portfolio package: fabric, hard-bound, magnetic closure, containing a saddle-stitched sophisticated design approach, small booklet of our qualifications, and elastic slip for the flash drive.</p>

                                <p>As a member of the proposed design team, I applied my skills to elevating our site plans, information graphics, and space summaries. Our ability to explain and present—not just have—the ideas, I believe, is a big reason why we won the competition.</p>

                                <p>The aforementioned identity work did not extend to a full brand. Therefore, as part of the proposal, I included elements to support the proposed architectural "place-making." This included a mood board with color palette, signage concepts, and environmental graphics to appear in our renderings.</p>
